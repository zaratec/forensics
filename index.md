Welcome! This site is dedicated to teaching you all about forensics problems - 
specifically those of the host-based forensics flavor. If you were expecting
something different on this page, see the note at the bottom. :)


# What is host-based forensics

So what is this "host-based" flavor of forensics? It mostly involves the 
analysis of _file systems_ and _files_. Analysis can include the following for 
files and file systems:

* **Finding/interpretting (hidden) information:** (ie. steganography, recovering deleted files, JavaScript in PDFs, VBScript in Microsoft Office documents, etc.)
* **Fixing something broken:** (ie. broken headers, corrupted disks, missing information in files, etc.)


# How to practice

We've looked into ways of auto-generating different types of these problems for
practice. Repetition is useful in learning and strengthening skills and we felt 
that this would provide an environment with such benefits. You can get started 
below.

If you've come here looking for MiniCTF and web exploitation problems, we've 
unfortunately taken it down, but you are welcome to check out the files for
