# Getting Started: Training & Tutorial

We aren't so cruel as to throw you into the deep end with no life ring. 
This section will teach you how to navigate and solve challenges starting from the beginning,
giving you exposure to four of the main filesystems and types of problems you may see.

There are two practice challenges, each with many separate subchallenges within:

1. **Disk Image:** [The content is accessible on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/zaratec/forensics/tree/master/docker).
2. **Android Memory:** [Accessible separately on Google Drive due to size](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NEqZFq3k8d5kyVpbw3MHjDN7CL9RCCOB).

Most of the challenges are autogenerated. The challenge questions and walkthrough are below.



### Tutorial Structure: 

We provide you with a single image containing several challenges within, with an additional memory image. 
The idea is to make a small multi-step environment that students can learn from, building upon previous knowledge.

## Image 1: NTFS, Ext3, FAT

### Setup

Follow [the setup instructions](./platform.html). After generation, you should have `hdd.img` and `flags.txt`
in your `docker/` directory. Do not look at `flags.txt`, as it will tell you the location of the challenge file
and the accompanying flag.

### NTFS
#### Questions & Walkthrough

(Unfamiliar with these terms? Here is a good resource link to get brushed up!)

| Topic (NTFS)                  |  Description                                                       |

| Part 1: Deleted File Recovery | (NTFS) Can you find the flag in the deleted file?                  |
| Part 2: Grep                  | (NTFS) It's in there somewhere pt 2 (regex on a file? impossibru!) |
| Part 3: Broken header         | (NTFS) Images have Heads too! This image is broken somehow: how?   |
| Part 4: File Carving          | (NTFS) What is the file containing this keyword?                   |

#### Solutions:

**Part 1**

```
-Use tsk_recover, autopsy, or other file recovery tool
-View file
```

**Part 2**

`$ grep -i [file/partition] “picoCTF“`

**Part 3**

```
View jpg image, see it’s broken
View in hex editor
Research jpg headers, compare and find the missing part of the header
Use bless or other hex editor to re-insert missing piece
```

**Part 4**

`TBD`



### FAT

#### Questions & Walkthrough
| Topic (FAT)                   |  Description                                                       |

| Part 1: Broken PDF            | (FAT)Another broken file problem. But this time it's a PDF!        |
| Part 2: Metadata              | (FAT) BUT IS IT META???                                            |


### Solutions:

**Part 1**

```
Attempt to open pdf, see it’s broken
View in hex editor
Research pdf headers, find the missing part of the header or file content
Use bless or other hex editor to re-insert missing piece
```

**Part 2**

`TBD`


### ext3

#### Questions & Walkthrough

| Part 1: Basic information     | (ext3) Md5sum, File System Type, Block Size, Inode Size?           |
| Part 2: Strings               | (ext3) By a Thread: It's in there somewhere!                       |
| Part 3: Windows Registry      | (ext3) Dig through the hive - where's the flag?                    |

#### Solutions

**Part 1**

```
md5sum [file]
tune2fs -l /dev/[ext3]
Ext3 block + inode size:
| grep -i 'block size'
| grep -i ‘inode size'
```

**Part 2**

`$ strings [file/partition]`

**Part 3**

```
Use Python libraries (hivex or python-registry) or tools (AccessData Registry Viewer)
to view the registry contents and find the flag.
```

### Setup
The challenge is a bit bigger, so you'll have to [download it and its generator script from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NEqZFq3k8d5kyVpbw3MHjDN7CL9RCCOB).
