# Forensics

This repo is dedicated to provide training resources on host-based forensics 
topics. We give a Dockerfile that can generate a single image file containing
several forensics challenges within it. The website is to help walk through the
types of challenges and how students may go about them.

Refer to the [website](index.md) and [setup instructions](platform.md) for more info.
